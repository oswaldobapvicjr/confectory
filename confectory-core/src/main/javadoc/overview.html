    <title>API Overview</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
       This is the API specification for the core part of the <strong>Confectory</strong> project.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Confectory</strong> is a modular framework, designed to hide the complexity of handling
       configuration files for Java applications in general, providing a reliable and fast API for parsing
       data from different <b>sources</b> (e.g.: file or URL) in a variety of formats and querying data
       transparently, using a <b>unified data query language</b>: JSONPath.
    </p>
    <p>
       The core part of the project defines the base API and provides basic standard functionality, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          The <code>Configuration</code> class, which is typically a combination of a <code>Source</code>
          and a <code>Mapper</code>, producing configuration data that can be retrieved in a variety of formats 
       </li>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          The <code>ConfigurationContainer</code> class, for management of multiple configuration objects
       </li>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          Built-in <code>Source</code> implementations for loading local resources from file system and classpath 
       </li>
       <li style="margin-bottom:6px">
          Built-in <code>Mapper</code> implementations for delivering contents as <code>String</code>,
          <code>Properties</code>, <code>JSONObject</code> (using <code>smart-json</code> as default provider)
          or POJO (user-defined beans)
       </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
